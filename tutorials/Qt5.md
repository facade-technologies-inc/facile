# Qt5 Tutorial (Team #19033)

Welcome to the Qt5 lazy tutorial!

## Installation (Windows 10)
Since our team is going to be using windows 10 exclusively, I will only address how to install Qt5 on Windows 10.

WARNING: Installing Qt will take up about 50 GB on your hard drive. If you don't have enough space, clear some space on your hard drive before proceeding.

1. Go to the following web page: https://www.qt.io/download
1. Select "Go open source" near the bottom of the page.
1. Click download.
1. Run the .exe file that was downloaded.
1. In the installer:
  1. Click next.
  1. Either create an account or log in if you already have one.
  1. Click Next.
  1. By default, the install location is C:\Qt. I recommend keeping it. Click next.
  1. On the "Select Components" page, make sure "Latest releases" is checked on the left and all other boxes on the left are unchecked. Make sure "Developer and Designer Tools" is filled and Qt 5.13.1 is checked. Click Next. WARNING: This will take up about 50GB on your hard drive.
  1. accept the License agreement.
  1. Select where you want your menu shortcuts. I recommend the default "Qt". Click Next.
  1. click "Install" only if you have enough disk space.
