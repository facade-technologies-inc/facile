This Chapter contains definitions for all terms relating to Facile.

.. glossary::
    Action Pipeline
        A component created during the design process that describes a set of actions to perform
        in the target GUI. An action pipeline has inputs, outputs and a description. Each action
        pipeline is directly translated into a Python function and included in the API by the API
        Compiler.

    Audacity
        An open source audio editing program. It's used as one of the example target applications.

    Application Programming Interface (API)
        Generic term for a software library that allows developers to interface with an existing
        software system.

    API Compiler
        The component of Facile responsible for generating custom Python APIs that will control
        the target GUI.

    API Design Process
        The sequence of actions performed in the Facade builder by the user to create a custom
        API. This is a two-phase process where the user must:

        1. Identify GUI components and visibility behaviors
        #. Connect action pipelines to describe high levels of functionality that will be \
           manifested in the generated API.

    Facile
        The application for which this documentation was created. It is used to generate custom
        APIs for programs that provide a graphical user interface.

    Facile Project
        To generate an API, a project must be created. Projects store the models and settings
        associated with the API of interest.

    Graphical User Interface (GUI)
        A part of an application that is displayed to the user and can be interacted with using
        the keyboard and mouse.

    GUI Component
        A generic term for any part of a GUI. They can be components that the user can see and
        interact with such as:

        .. hlist::
            :columns: 3

            * Labels
            * Buttons
            * Text Edit Fields
            * Sliders
            * Radio Buttons
            * Check Boxes

        GUI Components can also be elements can also be containers of various types that the user
        may not notice.

    PyAutoGUI
        A cross-platform Python package that uses image recognition and screen placement to
        interact with GUI components. This package is used by Facile to detect and interact with GUI
        components. It is used by both Facile and the APIs produced by Facile.

    PyWinAuto
        A Python package for the Windows operating system that uses Windows accessibility
        technology to interact with GUI components. This package is used by Facile to detect and
        interact with components. It is also used by the APIs produced by Facile.

    Target Application
        The application to be controlled by a Facile-generated API. Only applications developed
        with the following technologies can be controlled:

        .. hlist::
            :columns: 3

            * MFC
            * VB6
            * VCL
            * Legacy
            * WinForms
            * WPF
            * Qt5
            * Store App
            * Browser

    Target GUI
        The graphical user interface of the target application

    Visibility Behavior
        A term used to describe the visibility characteristics of specific components of the
        target GUI.

        When the user clicks component 1, component 2 ensues. Component 2 could be hidden or open
        a new window(s), panel(s), or GUI components(s).

        Visibility behaviors manifest themselves visibly in the Facade Builder in the form of labeled arrow in a
        directed graph. They are critical to the functionality of the API compiler because to interact with a GUI
        component, the API first has to know how to make the component visible.

    Win32API
        Microsoft's core set of application programming interfaces (APIs) available in the Microsoft Windows operating
        systems. Almost all Windows programs interact with the Windows API. The existence of this library allows Windows
        applications to be controlled by custom APIs generated by Facile.
